Hello everyone, my name is Mario del Rincón García. I studied Informatics Engineering.

This is one of the projects i had to do during the career, specifically for the service-oriented systems course. 

This project consists of a simple restful web service for a bank website. You can see the statement to have more context of it. I had to do the service and the customer to prove 
my web service. We used Java and Tomcat to implemented it.
